# Python-Code-Explainer

This project is a Python Code Explainer application that utilizes the Google PaLM API and Gradio to provide step-by-step explanations of Python code snippets. The app is designed to help users understand how a given piece of Python code works by breaking it down into detailed steps and checkpoints.

## Features
Uses Google PaLM API to generate explanations for Python code snippets.
Provides detailed, step-by-step breakdowns of code execution.
Offers intermediate checkpoints and results to help understand the code flow.
Simple and intuitive user interface powered by Gradio.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
A Google PaLM API key

## Steps
Install the required packages:
```pip install google-generativeai gradio```

Set up your Google PaLM API key:
Open the script file and replace your-api-key-here with your actual Google PaLM API key.
```palm.configure(api_key='your-api-key-here')```

## Usage
To run the Python Code Explainer application, simply execute the script:
```python app.py```

## Output
The application will provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of the given code snippet, including intermediate checkpoints and results.

## Gradio Interface
The application uses Gradio to create an interactive user interface. The UI consists of:

Input: A textbox to input your Python code snippet.
Output: A textbox displaying the detailed explanation of the provided code snippet.

Here how the Interface will look like :
